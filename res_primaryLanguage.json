Results  showed  that  the  MSCI  USA  could  be predicted based on the other 34 indices but the precision was  still  far  from  perfection.  However, NNs  beat  two benchmark models (LightGBM and ARMAX)to emerge as   the   better   choice   for   model.   Especially,   ANN outperformed   the  benchmark   by   about   19.1%,   the highest margin amongst the NNs in this experiment.",
